## The Configuration for Spells ## #
################################## #

## When you are configuring your spells, we expect seconds to be parsed. If you wish to use ticks, append 't' to the value.
## e.g 600t = 600 ticks = 30 seconds.
## while if you don't append 't' it would be 600 seconds which is equal to 5 minutes.
